<p style="font-size: 18px; margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 650px"><strong>Marilyn Monroe</strong> <em>(born Norma Jeane Mortenson; June 1, 1926 – August 5, 1962)</em> was an American actress and model.
Although she was a top-billed actress for only a decade, her films grossed $200 million by the time of her 
unexpected death in 1962. She continues to be considered a major popular culture icon.</p>


<p style="font-size: 18px; margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 650px">Born and raised in Los Angeles, Monroe spent most of her childhood in foster homes and an orphanage 
and married for the first time at the age of sixteen. While working in a factory as part of the war 
effort in 1944, she met a photographer and began a successful pin-up modeling career. The work led to 
short-lived film contracts with Twentieth Century-Fox and Columbia Pictures. After a series of minor film roles, 
she signed a new contract with Fox in 1951. Over the next two years, she became a popular actress with roles in several comedies.</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px; margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 700px">Some of her most famous movies are...</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-left: 100px">Some Like it Hot</li>
<li style="margin-left: 100px">Gentlemen Prefer Blondes</li>
<li style="margin-left: 100px">Monkey Business</li>
<li style="margin-left: 100px">Niagara</li>
<li style="margin-left: 100px">Bus Stop</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-size: 18px; margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 650px">When beginning to develop her star image, 20th Century-Fox wanted Monroe to replace the 
aging Betty Grable, their most popular "blonde bombshell" of the 1940s. While the 1940s had been the heyday of actresses 
perceived as tough and smart, such as Katharine Hepburn and Barbara Stanwyck, who appealed to women-dominated audiences, 
the studio wanted Monroe to be a star of the new decade that would draw men to movie theaters. She played a significant 
part in the creation of her public image from the beginning, and towards the end of her career exerted almost full control 
over it. Monroe devised many of her publicity strategies, cultivated friendships with gossip columnists such as Sidney 
Skolsky and Louella Parsons, and controlled the use of her images. Besides Grable, she was often compared to another 
iconic blonde, 1930s film star Jean Harlow. The comparison was partly prompted by Monroe, who named Harlow as her 
childhood idol, wanted to play her in a biopic, and even employed Harlow's hair stylist to color her hair.</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px; margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 650px">Although Monroe's screen persona as a dim-witted but sexually attractive blonde was a carefully crafted act, 
audiences and film critics believed it to be her real personality and that she was not acting in her comedies. 
This became an obstacle in her later career, when she wanted to change her public image and pursue other kinds 
of roles, or to be respected as a businesswoman. Academic Sarah Churchwell, who has studied narratives about Monroe, has stated:</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px; margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 650px"><em>"The biggest myth is that she was dumb. The second is that she was fragile. The third is that she couldn't act. She was far from 
dumb, although she was not formally educated, and she was very sensitive about that. But she was very smart indeed – and very 
tough. She had to be both to beat the Hollywood studio system in the 1950s. The dumb blonde was a role – she was an actress, 
for heaven's sake! Such a good actress that no one now believes she was anything but what she portrayed on screen."</em></p>

<p style="font-size: 18px; margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 650px"> Although Monroe was a comedic actress
and seemed happy and cheerful all the time, it is known that she suffered from depression throughout the years. There are many factors which may have had an effect on Marilyn Monroe’s psychological state. 
The first factor is her family life; mental illness was hereditary on her mother’s side. After her father 
abandoned the family Marilyn’s mother was admitted into several mental institutions because of depression and 
schizophrenic tendencies. This left Marilyn to spend a great deal of her childhood in orphanages and eleven different 
foster homes. As well as having the hardship of living in foster homes, she was also mistreated in several of them, 
including experiencing sexual abuse.</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px; margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 650px">When Monroe entered into the entertainment industry, she was encouraged to change her personal appearance into 
what we recognize her as today, including her signature platinum blonde hair. Besides her appearance, Marilyn Monroe 
was also forced to put on a facade of who she was, hiding her intelligence and interests, and showing her “dumb blonde” 
persona to the world through Hollywood. Essentially, she was separated into who she truly was, Norma Jean, and who she 
was made into, Marilyn Monroe. Monroe did not have contact with her family; she was treated for her psychological symptoms, 
and constantly was observed; although, besides these people and her publicists and Hollywood connections, she did not have 
contact with the outside world.  After several years of acting, Marilyn Monroe’s mental illnesses 
began to catch up with her.  During the filming of Seven Year Itch she would constantly forget her lines, and cost the 
production money because of how many retakes that had to be done.  After this she began to participate in substance abuse, 
taking sleeping pills on a regular basis, drinking to intoxication, and using drugs on set. She was later let fired while 
working on the film Something’s Got to Give, and ended up in a mental institution afterwards.</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px; margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 700px">Monroe was found dead in the bedroom of her 
Brentwood home by her psychiatrist, Dr. Ralph Greenson, in the early morning hours of August 5, 1962. Several 
conspiracy theories about Monroe's death have been proposed in the decades afterwards, including murder and 
accidental overdose. The murder speculations first gained mainstream attention with the publication of Norman 
Mailer's Marilyn: A Biography in 1973, and in the following years became widespread enough for the Los Angeles County 
District Attorney John Van de Kamp to conduct a "threshold investigation" in 1982 to see whether a criminal investigation 
should be opened. No evidence of foul play was found.</p>
